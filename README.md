 My Introduction to webpack, courtesy of the Odin Project

### Major Takeaways
- For one, (in this project) webpack allows for utilizing tabs to switch the content displayed on a page. This prevents unnecessary HTTP requests.

- Understanding how to load content to become bundled into the final output (loaders).

- Major resource: [webpack website](https://webpack.js.org/)

- Tons more to learn here... and it definitely took this project for me to see what the actual point of webpack is.
